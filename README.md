## Status and Details
- **Project Status**: [Completed]
- **Date Coded**: 07/10/21


## Technology
- **Language**: Python 3.6.9
- **Libraries**: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, sklearn
- **Set up File**: N/A


## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to identify potential fraudulent activity. Such analysis is important in the financial sector.


### Project Description
The dataset used for this analysis is a stock dataset with over 2500 observations. The data denotes the percentage of changes in the daily closing price of stocks for Microsoft, Ford and Bank of America. 

A one-class SVM is trained on the dataset to identify outliers, potentially preventing fraudulent activity. The results are plotted on a 3D plot with a colour coded system to denote outlier score.


### Objectives
- Train one-class SVM to return outlier labels
- Plot results to visualise potential outliers


## Data Science Methodology
The below subsections outline the standard methodology of data scientists.


### Problem Formulation
Market manipulation can causes harm to investors in such companies. By reducing fraudulent stock activity, investors can be protected.


## Conclusions
The resultant plots for this project clearly show outliers in a dark red. The closer to thje center of the plot, the closer to blue the colour and also the less likely the observation is to be fraudulent.
